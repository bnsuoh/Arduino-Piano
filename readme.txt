% Arduino Piano

- This code is for an Arduino & Processing piano project. When buttons of the piano are pressed, the corresponding sound file is played from the database. The piano consists of thirty six pairs of copper tapes. When you touch a pair, you make a bridge between the two tapes that completes the circuit they are in. Current then passes through you and reaches a transistor, which is a part of both this circuit and a second one. This completes the second circuit, leading it to light the appropriate led and lead the computer to emit the right sound.
